Python is a well-known high-level programming language. The Python script is a file containing Python-written code. The file containing Python script has the extension ‘.py’ or can also have the extension ‘.pyw’ if it is being run on a
through the basic steps and understand how a script works.

Here is a simple code to print ‘Hello World!’.

Python3
print('Hello World!')
To Execute this program, first we have to save it with the ‘.py’ extension. Then we can execute this file with the help of the terminal.

Here, the print() function is to print out any text written within the parenthesis. We can write the text that we want to be printed using either a single quote as shown in the above script or a double quote.

If you are coming from any other language then you will also notice that there is no semicolon at the end of the statement as, with Python, you do not need to specify a semicolon at the end of the line. And also we don’t need to include or import any files to run a simple Python script.

There are various ways to run a script in Python but before going toward the different ways to run a Python script, we first have to check whether a Python interpreter is installed on the system or not. So in Windows, open ‘cmd’ (Command Prompt) and type the following command.

python -V
This command will give the version number of the Python interpreter installed or will display an error if otherwise.
Example 2: Using Interactive Execution
Run the following lines one by one in the interactive mode.

name = "Shadow"
print("My name is " + name
